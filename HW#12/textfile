To solve this problem, combine the costs of wells and pipes into a list, sort the list by cost, and then use the Union Find algorithm to connect houses efficiently.
We iterate through the sorted list of pipes, connecting houses if they are not already connected, and add the cost of the pipe to the total cost. 
Finally, we return the total cost as the minimum cost to supply water to all houses.
