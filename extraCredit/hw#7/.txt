To solve the problem, we first sort the intervals based on their start times. 
We then use two priority queues to keep track of available servers and servers that have finished their current job.
We iterate through the sorted intervals, assigning jobs to servers and updating their availability accordingly.
If no server is available, we increment the count of required servers. 
The minimum number of servers required is the sum of the number of servers in use and the count of required servers. 
The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting the intervals and processing them, and a space complexity of O(n) to store the intervals and priority queues.
