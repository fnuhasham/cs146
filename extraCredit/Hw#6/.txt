To solve the Three Sum problem efficiently, the algorithm first sorts the input array.
Then, it iterates through the array, using a two-pointer technique to find triplets that sum up to zero. 
The algorithm avoids duplicates by skipping identical elements. Overall, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.
