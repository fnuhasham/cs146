To find the longest palindrome that can be built from a given string, we count the occurrences of each character. 
We add the maximum even count of each character to our palindrome length and keep track if any character has an odd count. 
If there is at least one character with an odd count, we add 1 to the length to account for a potential center character. 
This approach ensures we use all characters efficiently to form palindromes.
