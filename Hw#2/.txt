To find the first bad version among a sequence of versions numbered from 1 to n, the binary search algorithm is employed.The binary search approach starts with a range from 1 to n.
It continually halves the range based on whether the middle version is bad or not. If it's bad, the right boundary is set to mid; otherwise, the left boundary is set to mid + 1. 
This process continues until the range converges to a single version, which is then returned as the first bad version.
