The code uses dynamic programming to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up a given amount. 
It iterates through each coin denomination and updates an array with the minimum number of coins needed for each amount from 0 to the target amount. 
If a valid combination is found, it then returns the minimum number of coins; otherwise, it returns -1.
